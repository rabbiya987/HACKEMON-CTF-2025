Description: ðŸ“œ Mystery Clue:

"Hidden high where the gods can see, I whisper through empty eyes.
My builders never carved their words, but their walls speak in silence.
A refuge above the clouds, untouched by the enemyâ€™s greed.
One manâ€™s journey in 1911 rewrote my fate, but was I truly his to find?
Count my openings, and you shall see the forgotten passage of time."

Can you name this place???Sometimes, you are closer than you think
